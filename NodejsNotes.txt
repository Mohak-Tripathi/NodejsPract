What is Nodejs- 

1. Nodejs is a "JavaScript runtime (enviornment)" built on "Chrome's V8" Javascript engine.
2. Nodejs is A "JavaScript running on the server".  (Earlier you could use JS only in browser)

Explaination => runtime environemnt is literally just the enviornment your application is running in.

V8 JS Engine =>
1. Built for google Chrome 
2. Just-in-Time compiler
3. No interpreter

What Engines do?
JS Code ===> Browser JS Engine ===> Machine Code (10001010101)


History of Nodejs- 
In 2009 an idea came in mind of "Ryan Dahl" (Google Engineer) that why not run "JS outside browser", so he took "V8 engine" and 
embedded in a "C++ program" and called it "Node.exe" later on become "Node.js"

So C++  AND V8 Engine => Node.exe => Node.js

Remember that = Nodejs is not any framework or library or language. It is just JS run time Environent. 

Fun Fact=> In 1995 Netscape written a program called "Netscape Enterprise Server" which allowed Developer to run JS at server side. 


When to use NodeJs ?

1. I/O bound 
timeframe- 13:40 
It can happen multiple requests at the same time so it is non blocking. So it handle asynchronous requests pretty well. 
10 sec request OK but if 3 sec request came. So Nodejs will fetch 3 sec request and render it and after 7 sec it will render 10 sec vaali original request. 



2. Data Streaming Applications 
Like Netflix
And infinite scrolling vaali applications like instagram, facebook etc

3. Real time chat application Ex- whatsapp 


When Not to use NodeJs ?

1. CPU intensive applications

NodeJs REPL -
The REPL feature of Nodejs is very useful in experimenting with Nodejs codes and to debug Javascript codes. 

REPL stands for=> 
Read - Reads user's input, parses the input into Javascript data-structure, and stores in memory. 
Eval - Takes and evaluates the data structure. 
Print- Prints the result. 
Loop- Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl+c twice.
